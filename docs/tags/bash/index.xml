It is good to write those commands down, so that they don&amp;rsquo;t get lost and anyone can execute them. I used to maintain a Makefile as a simple way to organize and share tasks with others.
As the complexity grows, and more functionality is needed, Makefile becomes more unreadable. It feels like using the wrong tool for the job.</description></item></channel></rss>
