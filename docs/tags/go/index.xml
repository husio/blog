      <description>This is a collection of testing techniques and patterns that I have learned throughout my career of being a Go programmer.&#xA;testing package basics The Go standard library comes with the testing package which provides a solid base for writing tests.&#xA;Each test should be a separate function. A test function must accept a single argument of type *testing.T.&#xA;A test for a functoin isEven could look like this:&#xA;func TestIsEven(t *testing.</description>

      <description>In Go 1.13 error wrapping was introduced as part of the standard library. This post was written before the update to the errors package.&#xA;Go is a language that does not provide exceptions. Instead, an operation can return an error. Errors are values that implement the error interface.&#xA;I have worked with several errors handling patterns over the years and I would like to summarize my experience focusing on the good solutions.</description>

      <description>Writing an application that handles concurrent traffic from a lot of clients in a performant way is not an easy task. To narrow this problem to web applications only, serving as many HTTP requests as possible in a short time is often a challenge.&#xA;In most cases of an HTTP application, optimizing access to the database can be the easiest and the best first step.&#xA;Caching database access Using a database that provides plenty of functionality and storing data in denormalized form makes development easier.</description>

      <description>When writing a web application, we have to decide how to access data. Where to get it from, how to store it, how to manipulate it. Storage engines can vary, from being a single SQLite file to cache server or even an external service exposing an API.&#xA;There are many ways this topic can be addressed. I will explain how a simple and straightforward solution can be evolved into a more sophisticated one.</description>
